1. Every activity that a supply chain conducts has inherent risk that an unexpected disruption can occur.
2. The global reach, shorter product life cycles, and increasing customer requirements => small disturbances = fatal impact
3. examples of risks:
	loss of a critical supplier, 
	a major fire at a manufacturing plant,
	or an act of terrorism
4. can lead to lost sales and even market share
   increase costs due to premium,
   expedited logistics services
5. must be designed to incorporate event readiness, provide an 		efficient and effective response, and be capable of 		recovering to their original state or even better.
6. a subject of interest in relatively new emerging disciplines such as risk management and supplychain management.


Supply Chain Resilience
The most effective way to deliver the needed supplies to a disaster-impacted area is by re-establishing
pre-disaster supply chains. Building resilience within, and providing for the rapid restoration of, supply
chain systems is key to responding to any catastrophic incident.


Drawing from recent literature, Chen, Hsieh, and Wee (2016) cluster 11 main criteria for supplier selection, alongside their definitions, these are: 
finance, quality, delivery, relationship, service, technology, supply facilities, management, efficacy, environment and risk factors.
